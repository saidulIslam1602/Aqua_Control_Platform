# Data Engineering Concept Directory

This directory contains theoretical explanations of Data Engineering concepts, patterns, and technologies used in the AquaCulture Platform.

## Files Overview

### 1. EventStreaming
**Focus**: Apache Kafka and event streaming

**Topics Covered**:
- What is event streaming
- Kafka architecture (topics, partitions, consumers, producers)
- Consumer groups and load balancing
- Schema Registry for schema management
- Kafka Streams for stream processing
- Real-world use cases
- Best practices

**Key Takeaway**: Kafka provides a robust, scalable platform for event streaming, enabling real-time data processing and decoupled microservices.

### 2. TimeSeriesDatabases
**Focus**: TimescaleDB and time-series data

**Topics Covered**:
- What are time-series databases
- Why time-series databases
- TimescaleDB hypertables and chunks
- Compression and retention policies
- Continuous aggregates
- Time-series queries
- Analytics functions

**Key Takeaway**: TimescaleDB extends PostgreSQL with time-series capabilities, providing automatic partitioning, compression, and optimized queries for time-stamped data.

### 3. StreamProcessing
**Focus**: Stream processing patterns and Kafka Streams

**Topics Covered**:
- What is stream processing
- Streams, windows, and state
- Stream processing operations (map, filter, aggregate, join)
- Kafka Streams architecture
- State management
- Windowing strategies
- Exactly-once processing

**Key Takeaway**: Stream processing enables real-time data processing, allowing systems to react to events as they happen with low latency.

### 4. MLFeatureEngineering
**Focus**: Feature engineering for machine learning

**Topics Covered**:
- What is feature engineering
- Types of features (time, statistical, trend, lag, interaction)
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Time-based features (cyclical encoding, seasonal)
- Statistical features (rolling windows, aggregations)
- Domain-specific features
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Feature caching

**Key Takeaway**: Feature engineering transforms raw data into features that help ML models learn patterns. Good features are crucial for model performance.
