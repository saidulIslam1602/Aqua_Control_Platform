# Layers Concept Directory

This directory contains theoretical explanations of how the Domain and Application layers relate, depend on each other, and work together in Clean Architecture.

## Files Overview

### 1. DomainApplicationRelationship.md
**Focus**: Overall relationship between Domain and Application layers

**Topics Covered**:
- Overview of both layers
- Dependency direction (Application → Domain)
- What each layer contains
- How they work together with examples
- Communication patterns
- Responsibilities separation
- Complete flow examples
- Benefits of separation
- Common mistakes to avoid

**Key Takeaway**: Application depends on Domain, Domain is independent. They work together to implement business logic with clear boundaries.

### 2. DependencyFlow.md
**Focus**: How dependencies flow in Clean Architecture

**Topics Covered**:
- The dependency rule (dependencies point inward)
- Layer hierarchy
- Why this direction
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Examples of correct and incorrect dependencies
- Dependency injection and dependencies
- Circular dependency prevention
- Testing implications
- Common violations

**Key Takeaway**: Dependencies always point toward the Domain layer. Domain has zero dependencies on other layers (except interfaces it defines).

### 3. WorkingTogether.md
**Focus**: Practical mechanisms of collaboration

**Topics Covered**:
- Orchestration pattern (Application orchestrates, Domain executes)
- Communication mechanisms:
  - Direct method calls
  - Domain events
  - Value objects
- Data flow (command and query flows)
- Responsibility matrix
- Complete use case examples
- Error handling collaboration
- Event-driven collaboration

**Key Takeaway**: Application layer orchestrates operations by calling Domain methods. Domain executes business logic and raises events. Application handles events and coordinates infrastructure.

## Reading Order

**For Beginners**:
1. Start with `DomainApplicationRelationship.md` - Get the big picture
2. Read `DependencyFlow.md` - Understand why dependencies flow this way
3. Read `WorkingTogether.md` - See how they collaborate in practice

**For Reference**:
- Use `DependencyFlow.md` when checking dependency rules
- Use `WorkingTogether.md` when implementing use cases
- Use `DomainApplicationRelationship.md` for architectural decisions

## Quick Reference

### Dependency Rule
```
Application → Domain ✅
Domain → Application ❌
Domain → Infrastructure (interfaces only) ✅
```

### Responsibilities
- **Domain**: Business logic, validation, events
- **Application**: Orchestration, use cases, DTOs

### Communication
- **Direct calls**: Application calls Domain methods
- **Events**: Domain raises, Application handles
- **Value objects**: Application creates, Domain validates
