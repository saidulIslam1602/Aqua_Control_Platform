• Entity Framework Core with TimescaleDB for time-series sensor data
• Comprehensive security middleware (CSP, HSTS, rate limiting)
• Health checks, performance monitoring & structured logging with Serilog
• FluentValidation for input sanitization & business rule enforcement

**Frontend (Vue.js 3 & TypeScript)**
• Modern UI with Element Plus components & responsive design
• Pinia state management with persistence & optimistic updates
• Real-time dashboard with live sensor monitoring & alert system
• Error boundaries, loading states & comprehensive error handling
• PWA capabilities with service worker for offline functionality
• Production-ready performance monitoring & analytics

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
• Docker containerization with multi-stage builds & security hardening
• Production-ready orchestration with secrets management
• TimescaleDB hypertables with automatic compression & retention policies
• Redis caching, Nginx reverse proxy with security headers
• Prometheus & Grafana monitoring stack with custom dashboards
• Automated backup system with verification & 30-day retention

**Security & Production Features**
• Enterprise-grade authentication with role-based access control
• Security headers, input validation & SQL injection prevention
• Comprehensive audit trails with IP tracking & correlation IDs
• Automated testing framework (xUnit, Vitest, Playwright)
• Production deployment with secrets management & resource limits

**Technical Outcomes:**
• Implemented comprehensive security following OWASP guidelines
• Achieved scalable architecture with real-time data processing
